title: Bitcoin RPC
---

The Bitcoin RPC source connects to a Bitcoin Core node via JSON-RPC to fetch block data. It polls the node at regular intervals to detect new blocks and streams them through the Oura pipeline.

## Configuration

The following snippet shows an example of how to set up a Bitcoin RPC source:

```toml
[source]
type = "bitcoin-rpc"
rpc_url = "http://localhost:8332"
rpc_user = "myuser"
rpc_password = "mypassword"
rpc_interval = 30
```

### Section `source`:

- `type`: this field must be set to the literal value `bitcoin-rpc`.
- `rpc_url`: the URL of the Bitcoin RPC server (required).
- `rpc_user`: username for RPC authentication (optional).
- `rpc_password`: password for RPC authentication (optional).
- `rpc_interval`: polling interval in seconds to check for new blocks (optional, defaults to 30).

## Authentication

The Bitcoin RPC source supports optional authentication. If your Bitcoin node requires authentication, provide both `rpc_user` and `rpc_password`. For public nodes that don't require authentication, you can omit these fields.

## Examples

### Local Bitcoin Node with Authentication

```toml
[source]
type = "bitcoin-rpc"
rpc_url = "http://localhost:8332"
rpc_user = "bitcoinrpc"
rpc_password = "mypassword123"
rpc_interval = 30
```

### Public Bitcoin Node without Authentication

```toml
[source]
type = "bitcoin-rpc"
rpc_url = "http://public-bitcoin-node.example.com:8332"
rpc_interval = 60
```

### Bitcoin Testnet Node

```toml
[source]
type = "bitcoin-rpc"
rpc_url = "http://localhost:18332"
rpc_user = "testuser"
rpc_password = "testpass"
rpc_interval = 30
```

## Output Events

The Bitcoin source produces `ChainEvent::Apply` events containing parsed Bitcoin block data. Each event includes:

- Block hash and height information
- Complete block structure with transactions
- Timestamp and other block metadata

The events follow the same pattern as other Oura sources, allowing them to be processed by standard filters and sinks in the pipeline.
